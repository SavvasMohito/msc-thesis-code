    Validate the generated security requirements against the original business requirements:
    
    Original Requirements:
    {requirements_text}
    
    Requirements Analysis:
    {analyzed_requirements}
    
    Security Controls:
    {security_controls}
    
    AI/ML Security:
    {ai_security}
    
    Compliance Requirements:

    Perform comprehensive validation:
    
    1. COMPLETENESS (0-1 score):
       - Are all identified security concerns addressed?
       - Are there missing security domains?
       - Is coverage comprehensive across authentication, authorization, data protection, etc.?
    
    2. CONSISTENCY (0-1 score):
       - Do requirements contradict each other?
       - Are similar concerns handled consistently?
       - Do controls work together harmoniously?
    
    3. CORRECTNESS (0-1 score):
       - Are controls appropriate for identified risks?
       - Are standards applied correctly?
       - Are AI/ML controls relevant if AI is present?
    
    4. IMPLEMENTABILITY (0-1 score):
       - Are requirements specific and actionable?
       - Can developers implement these?
       - Are there ambiguous or vague requirements?
    
    5. ALIGNMENT (0-1 score):
       - Do security requirements align with business requirements?
       - Are we securing what actually needs to be built?
       - Are we over-engineering or under-protecting?
    
    Calculate overall score (average of above 5 scores).
    
    If score < 0.8, provide specific, actionable feedback on what to improve.
