Prioritization Framework\n\nPrioritization is critical for effective security implementation because it helps allocate limited resources to the most impactful areas, addressing the most significant risks and compliance requirements first. This ensures that the platform's security posture improves systematically, minimizing vulnerabilities while aligning with business goals.\n\n**Prioritization Criteria:**\n\n- **Risk Level**: Controls addressing critical and high-risk threats (identified through threat modeling) are prioritized first. This ensures that the most severe vulnerabilities, which could have the greatest impact on the system, are mitigated promptly.\n\n- **Compliance Deadlines**: Regulatory requirements and compliance deadlines influence immediate priority. Controls that are necessary to meet legal obligations are implemented early to avoid potential fines and sanctions.\n\n- **Technical Complexity**: Controls requiring foundational infrastructure are implemented early to enable subsequent controls. This ensures a stable base upon which more complex security measures can be built.\n\n- **Dependencies**: Controls that other security measures depend upon are prioritized accordingly. For example, implementing authentication before authorization ensures that subsequent security controls can be effectively applied.\n\n- **Resource Availability**: Implementation considers the availability of skilled personnel, tools, and budget. This ensures that the plan is feasible and that resources are used efficiently.\n\n- **Business Impact**: Controls protecting business-critical functions and data receive higher priority. This ensures that the organization's most important assets are secured first, minimizing potential disruptions.\n\nThese criteria work together to create a logical implementation sequence that balances security needs with practical constraints, ensuring a comprehensive and effective security posture.\n\n### 10.2. Phased Implementation Plan\n\n#### Phase: IMMEDIATE\n**Timeline:** 0-1 months  \n**Rationale:** This phase addresses critical vulnerabilities and compliance blockers that pose the greatest risk to the platform's security. Immediate action is necessary to protect sensitive data and ensure compliance with regulations.  \n**Controls to Implement:**\n- Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all user accounts\n- Enforce strong encryption for sensitive data in transit (TLS)\n- Enhance password security with secure hashing algorithms (e.g., bcrypt)\n- Establish basic logging of critical security events\n**Dependencies:**\n- Basic user authentication mechanisms\n\n#### Phase: SHORT-TERM\n**Timeline:** 1-3 months  \n**Rationale:** These controls build upon immediate security measures, focusing on improving access control and ensuring that logging and API security mitigate identified threats effectively.  \n**Controls to Implement:**\n- Enhance user authentication through comprehensive multi-factor authentication\n- Deploy role-based access controls across the admin dashboard\n- Implement comprehensive logging and monitoring for all administrative actions\n- Strengthen API security with input validation and HTTPS protocols\n- Begin encryption for all sensitive data at rest\n**Dependencies:**\n- Completion of TLS Implementation\n- Completion of multi-factor authentication\n\n#### Phase: MEDIUM-TERM\n**Timeline:** 3-6 months  \n**Rationale:** This phase focuses on enhancing security through advanced threat detection, automated testing, and third-party audits, requiring more planning and coordination.  \n**Controls to Implement:**\n- Deploy advanced threat detection systems and SIEM\n- Automate security testing processes (SAST/DAST)\n- Conduct third-party security audits and vulnerability assessments\n- Enhance data protection mechanisms, including data masking and tokenization\n**Dependencies:**\n- Completion of comprehensive logging setup\n- Established role-based access controls\n\n#### Phase: LONG-TERM\n**Timeline:** 6-12 months  \n**Rationale:** Strategic initiatives aimed at continuous security improvement and maturity, integrating advanced technologies and fostering a security-aware culture.  \n**Controls to Implement:**\n- Develop and integrate AI/ML-based security controls for anomaly detection\n- Conduct comprehensive penetration testing across all systems\n- Implement a security awareness and training program for all employees\n- Continuously improve security policies and procedures\n**Dependencies:**\n- Advanced threat detection capabilities\n- Security testing automation\n\n#### Phase: ONGOING\n**Timeline:** Continuous  \n**Rationale:** Essential security activities that require regular attention and are fundamental to maintaining a secure environment.  \n**Controls to Implement:**\n- Ongoing security monitoring and incident response readiness\n- Regular patch management and vulnerability scans\n- Periodic compliance audits and risk assessments\n- Continuous improvement of security controls based on evolving threats\n**Dependencies:** None\n\n### 10.3.
