Balance automated scanning with manual evaluations to prioritize high-risk areas based on business impact, adhering to shift-left security principles by incorporating security testing earlier and continuously. This approach ensures vulnerabilities are identified and remediated early, reducing the cost and impact of security incidents.\n\n### 11.2.
