Balance automated scanning with manual evaluations to prioritize high-risk areas based on business impact, adhering to shift-left security principles by incorporating security testing earlier and continuously. This proactive approach will help in identifying vulnerabilities in different phases, reduce remediation costs, and ensure compliance with security standards.\n\n### 11.2.

Compliance Verification\nOWASP ASVS compliance will be verified through automated tools and manual checks against regulatory requirements such as GDPR, CCPA, and PCI-DSS. Audit preparation will involve ensuring thorough documentation and evidence collection for external audits, including retention and deletion processes as stipulated in compliance guidelines. Recommendations will include engaging third-party auditors for comprehensive evaluations of compliance posture.\n\n### 11.4. Continuous Monitoring\nImplement Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) for real-time monitoring, supported by Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS) to identify and mitigate threats. All logs will be aggregated and analyzed for anomalies using security best practices, including anomaly detection and behavioral analytics. This data will integrate seamlessly into incident response processes to ensure prompt action against identified security events and compliance breaches.\n\n### 11.5.
