AI/ML Components Detected  \nThis section identifies all AI/ML components within the system that require specialized security controls.  \n\n1. **Recommendation System**: An AI-powered feature that suggests products to users based on their browsing history and preferences.  \n2. **Chatbot Interface**: Natural language processing chatbot providing customer support using large language models.  \n3. **Search Functionality**: Enhanced search capabilities that may leverage AI for relevance ranking and filtering of product results.  \n\n### 7.2. AI/ML Threat Model  \n\n| Component               | Identified Threats                              |\n|-------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|\n| Recommendation System    | - Data leakage from PII in training data       <br> - Prompt injection attacks on product suggestions  <br> - Adversarial inputs affecting recommendation quality |\n| Chatbot Interface         | - Prompt injection leading to unintended responses <br> - Model inversion revealing sensitive information <br> - Adversarial inputs causing harmful outputs |\n| Search Functionality      | - Prompt injection affecting search results <br> - Data leakage of user queries <br> - Adversarial inputs affecting search relevance |\n\n### 7.3. AI/ML Security Controls  \n\n#### Recommendation System  \n- **Prompt Injection Prevention**: Implement context-aware filtering to ensure user inputs do not manipulate the underlying recommendation logic.  \n- **Data Leakage Prevention**: Use anonymization techniques for training data and ensure sensitive PII is not used in model training.  \n- **Monitoring for Adversarial Inputs**: Regularly test the system with adversarial examples to identify and mitigate weaknesses.  \n\n#### Chatbot Interface  \n- **Input Validation for AI Inputs**: Enforce strict validation on user inputs to block potentially harmful submissions.  \n- **Output Filtering and Sanitization**: Apply filters to sanitize chatbot responses before displaying to users.  \n- **Model Access Controls**: Implement role-based access controls to restrict who can update or interact with the model.  \n\n#### Search Functionality  \n- **Rate Limiting and Abuse Prevention**: Set limits on the number of queries per user to prevent abuse and potential denial of service.  \n- **Monitoring for Adversarial Inputs**: Log and analyze unusual search queries to detect potential manipulation.  \n- **Model Versioning and Rollback Capabilities**: Maintain version control for the search model to allow rollback in case of adversarial exploitation.  \n\n### 7.4. Integration with Existing Security Controls  \nAI security controls integrate with existing security practices by extending authentication and authorization mechanisms (like multi-factor authentication) to AI components. Regular security audits and logs should include AI interactions, ensuring that behavioral monitoring is part of the overall security strategy. Furthermore, compliance with data protection regulations (e.g., GDPR) must be maintained for AI components, especially concerning data retention and user consent.\n\n### 7.5. AI/ML Monitoring Requirements  \n\n| Monitoring Area                 | Description                                         |\n|----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|\n| Adversarial Input Detection      | Monitor AI components for unexpected patterns in user input that may indicate adversarial behavior. |\n| Anomaly Detection in Outputs     | Track the responses generated by the AI to identify any anomalies or harmful outputs. |\n| User Interaction Logging         | Maintain logs of user interactions with AI components to analyze behavior and potential security incidents. |",
