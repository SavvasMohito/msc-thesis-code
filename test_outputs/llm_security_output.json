AI/ML Security Controls  \n\n#### Recommendation Systems  \n**Data Leakage Prevention**  \nImplement strict rules to ensure that recommendations are derived from sanitized datasets without any personally identifiable information (PII) included. Regularly audit data sources used for training.\n\n**Bias and Fairness Considerations**  \nConduct regular audits of the model\u2019s outputs for bias. Ensure diverse datasets for training to promote fairness in recommendations. Use fairness metrics to evaluate model bias.\n\n#### Chatbots  \n**Prompt Injection Prevention**  \nUtilize a predefined set of allowed prompts and queries for the chatbot interactions. Implement natural language processing controls to detect and mitigate attempts to manipulate interactions through prompt injection.\n\n**Input Validation for AI Inputs**  \nEnsure all inputs the chatbot receives are validated against a strict schema to prevent malicious content from being processed. Use techniques such as sanitization and normalization.\n\n**Output Filtering and Sanitization**  \nCreate filters for chatbot responses to ensure that outputs do not disclose sensitive information or demonstrate bias, ensuring all communication adheres to platform policies.\n\n**Monitoring for Adversarial Inputs**  \nImplement monitoring solutions that flag unusual patterns in user interactions intended to manipulate or deceive the AI, enabling prompt responses to unidentified threats.\n\n### 7.4. Integration with Existing Security Controls  \nThe AI/ML security controls align with standard security practices by complementing existing measures such as authentication protocols (multi-factor authentication), input validation, and data protection (encryption of sensitive data). For instance, output filtering for AI responses can work hand-in-hand with traditional input validation techniques, ensuring a more holistic security approach. Moreover, the monitoring of adversarial behavior can supplement existing network intrusion detection systems by providing additional context to potential threats.\n\n### 7.5.
